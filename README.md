# cljs-js-repl

An effort to make self-hosted cljs repls upgradeable.

To achieve this goal some subgoals must be met:

 * input stream abstraction (done)
 * async reader (partially done)
 * dynamic binding conveyance (done)
 * expose `eval`

Hopefully some of this work will find its way into lumo/plank or clojurescript proper.
